1. How to Get Help

Hello and welcome.

We're going to get started with the course in just a moment but before we do I want to tell you how

you can get help if you get stuck at any point during this course.

So there's three great ways to reach out to me.

The first is to post on the course discussion boards.

I usually check the Course discussion about once a day on Monday through Friday so I'll do my best to

get back to you as soon as possible if anything comes up.

The next best way to reach out to me is to send me a direct message on you to me.

I'm usually very good about responding to these requests and usually better about that than with the

Course Q&A.

Finally you can reach out to me via Twitter.

And here's my handle listed right here.

Twitter is a great way to reach out to me with short questions but if it's anything technical related

I usually recommend either posting on the course discussion or send me a PM because obviously with Twitter

we've got that character limit that makes technical discussions a little bit more challenging.

All right.

So that's the three ways to get help if you ever get stuck during this course.

Let's pause right now and we'll start talking about our first technical topic in the next video so I'll

see you in just a minute.
